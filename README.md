# Introduction
[COVID-19 AI Quantum Tensorflow](https://github.com/COVID-19-AI-Research-Project/COVID19-AI-Quantum-Tensorflow "COVID-19 AI Quantum Tensorflow") is a [Peter Moss COVID-19 AI Research Project](https://github.com/COVID-19-AI-Research-Project "Peter Moss COVID-19 AI Research Project") Artificial Intelligence & Quantum Technologies research and development project using Tensorflow Quantum.

This repository will provide several projects created by our team. Projects include installation scripts, documentation and code for Quantum AI algorithms built for fighting and understanding COVID-19.

The [Peter Moss COVID-19 AI Research Project](https://github.com/COVID-19-AI-Research-Project "Peter Moss COVID-19 AI Research Project") is a [Peter Moss Leukemia AI Research](https://github.com/COVID-19-AI-Research-Project "Peter Moss Leukemia AI Research") project. Our goal is to keep our research and technology open-source and free.

# Tensorflow Quantum

![GeniSysAI Server](Media/Images/tensorflow-quantum.jpg)

"TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ) is a quantum machine learning library for rapid prototyping of hybrid quantum-classical ML models. Research in quantum algorithms and applications can leverage Googleâ€™s quantum computing frameworks, all from within TensorFlow.

TensorFlow Quantum focuses on quantum data and building hybrid quantum-classical models. It integrates quantum computing algorithms and logic designed in Cirq, and provides quantum computing primitives compatible with existing TensorFlow APIs, along with high-performance quantum circuit simulators. Read more in the TensorFlow Quantum white paper." [Source:](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum "Source")
